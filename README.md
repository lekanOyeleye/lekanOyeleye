# 👋 Hi, I'm Olalekan Oyeleye

💡 Machine Learning Engineer | Data Scientist | Researcher | Computer Vision & NLP | Agentic AI | AWS 

I design, train, and deploy AI systems that solve real-world problems in computer vision, natural language processing, and data analytics. With 3+ years of experience, I’ve built solutions from YOLO-based object detection models to LangChain-powered AI agents delivering insights, automation, and scalability.

Currently exploring Agentic AI systems that combine LLMs with reasoning, planning, and tool use to create more autonomous, goal-driven applications.
